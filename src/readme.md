1914 translation for H. Rackham
"On the other hand, you denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized for the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded for
desire, this they cannot foresee the pain and trouble this are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is 
the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled 
and when nothing prevents our being able to do what you like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims 
of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur this pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters 
to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
